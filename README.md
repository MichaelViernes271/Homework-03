SIDE NOTE:

Good day, Sir Madrigalejos;

    I would like to ask for your advice for my git bash since it cannot upload in my github account even with ssh keys and tokens. The reference article can be linked here: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token. May I ask the propcedure appropriate to my situation?
    Thank you very much!
    
    Sincerely,
    
    Michael E. Viernes
